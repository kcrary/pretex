Setup directions:

1. Create working directory.

2. Clone pretex as a git submodule in a subdirectory named pretex.

3. Unpack pretex/install.tar into the working directory (not the pretex subdirectory),
   and edit the resulting files as appropriate.

4. Run make to build the document.


You can pull the submodule to get Pretex updates, which should be uncommon.
