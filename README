Setup directions:

1. Create working directory.

2. Clone pretex as a git submodule in a subdirectory named pretex.

3. In the pretex directory, make install.  This will copy seed files into the
   working directory.  Edit the resulting files as appropriate.

4. Run make to build the document.


You can pull the submodule to get Pretex updates, which should be uncommon.
